# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Introduction
Stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile, making it challenging to model stock prices accurately over time. This project aims to predict the stock prices using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The model utilizes historical equity share price data to predict future prices based on features such as Opening price, day High, day Low, Close price, and Volume.

## Project Overview
The proposed system involves several stages, from data collection to output generation. The project is divided into the following stages:
1. Raw Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction
4. Training the Neural Network
5. Output Generation

- `Stock Price Prediction.py`: The Python script containing the implementation of the LSTM model for stock price prediction.

## Stage Descriptions

### Stage 1: Raw Data Collection
Historical stock data is collected from Yahoo Finance. This data is essential for predicting future stock prices.

### Stage 2: Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing stage involves:
- **Data Discretization**: Reducing the data volume but retaining the essential patterns.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalizing the data to ensure consistency.
- **Data Cleaning**: Filling in missing values to maintain data integrity.
- **Data Integration**: Combining data from different sources into a cohesive dataset.

After preprocessing, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with testing data comprising 5-10% of the total dataset.

### Stage 3: Feature Extraction
Only relevant features (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) are selected and fed into the LSTM Neural Network for training.

### Stage 4: Training the Neural Network
The LSTM model is trained using the preprocessed data. The model consists of:
- A sequential input layer
- Two LSTM layers
- A dense layer with ReLU activation
- A dense output layer with a linear activation function

### Stage 5: Output Generation
The output value generated by the RNN's output layer is compared with the actual closing value. The predicted value is visualized and compared with the original value through a graph.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
